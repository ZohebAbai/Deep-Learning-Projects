# Best Deep Learning Projects for Advanced Learners 

#### Using both Tensorflow and PyTorch Libraries

**Get a glimpse of how similar/different these libraries are:**

**In each notebook, we shall train using free Google Colab resources and eventually deploy them as  gradio/streamlit app.**

## Projects under Tensorflow:

* **Tensorflow Fundamentals** [Tensors Basics](https://github.com/ZohebAbai/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/00_Tensorflow_Fundamentals.ipynb)
* **Regression** - [Custom Model on Medical Insurance Dataset](https://github.com/ZohebAbai/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/01_TF_Regression.ipynb)
* **Image Classification** - [Custom Model on Cifar10 Dataset](https://github.com/ZohebAbai/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/02_TF_Image_Classification.ipynb)
