# MLOps Notes:

ML Systems are more complicated than normal software because of the many *moving parts*: **data**, **models** and **code** are always changing during the systemâ€™s lifecycle.

## ML System Lifecycle

### Data Enginnering
Data engineering refers to the process of gathering data, exploring them, and transforming them before they are fed into the model. Steps include:
1. Data Sources Identification
2. Data Aggregation
3. Data Augmentation
4. Data Exploration 
5. Data Labelling
6. Data Validation
7. Data Transformation
8. Data Ingestion
   

### Model Enginnering
Model engineering on the other hand is a much newer field with not many standard solutions yet. Steps include:
1. Model Prototyping
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
4. Model Benchmarking
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Model Integration
7. Model Versioning
8. Model Packaging


### DevOps Enginnering
Like every software project, a machine learning application must be highly scalable, reliable, and always available. Steps include:
1. Model pushed into Production
2. Monitoring 
3. Scaling

**MLOps** is a relatively new term that describes the effort to build an end-to-end system that takes care of all the aforementioned steps of the pipeline.
